## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## Usage

1. **Select a programming language from the dropdown**:
   - Choose from JavaScript, Python, Java, C, or C++ to enable syntax highlighting for that language.

2. **Start typing or paste your code into the editor**:
   - Once a language is selected, begin typing or paste existing code into the editor area.

   - As you type or make changes, the code editor will highlight syntax according to the selected language.

   - The editor supports real-time updates, so you can see syntax highlighting update dynamically as you modify the code.
